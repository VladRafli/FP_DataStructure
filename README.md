# FP_DataStructure

This is our group repository for store final project code.

## What we make

We make a program that resembles how companies store credentials like password etc in database, which is protected with encryption, hashing, etc.

We make an implementation to secure a credentials from unwanted intruders if the credential store is being hacked and its contents keep secured.

- Encryption (Maybe use Caesar Cipher)
- Hashing (Graph Implementation)
- Salt (Random String to improve Hash Security)
